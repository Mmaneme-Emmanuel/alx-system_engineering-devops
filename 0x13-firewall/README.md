0x13. Firewall


A firewall is a network security device or software that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. Its primary purpose is to establish a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external networks, such as the internet, to prevent unauthorized access and protect against security threats.

Here's a simplified explanation of how a firewall works:

Traffic Filtering: When data packets travel across a network, they pass through the firewall. The firewall inspects each packet and compares it against a set of predefined rules or policies. These rules define what types of traffic are allowed or denied based on factors such as source and destination IP addresses, port numbers, and protocols.
Access Control: Based on the rules, the firewall makes decisions about whether to allow, block, or filter the incoming or outgoing traffic. For example, it may allow traffic on specific ports required for essential services like web browsing (HTTP on port 80) or email (SMTP on port 25), while blocking traffic on other ports that are commonly associated with malicious activities.
Stateful Inspection: Many modern firewalls use stateful inspection, which means they keep track of the state of active connections. This allows them to make more intelligent decisions by analyzing the context of the traffic flow, rather than just individual packets. For example, they can determine if a packet is part of an established connection or a new connection attempt.
Logging and Reporting: Firewalls often include logging and reporting features to record information about network traffic and security events. This can help network administrators analyze and identify potential security threats, monitor network activity, and troubleshoot network issues.
